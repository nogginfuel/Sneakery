# Sneakery

Sneakery is aimed at being a low profile / low visibility barrier for websites. I created it with the intent of using it as a way to launch a discrete login modal.

**This is currently a work in progress (WIP).**

#### Roadmap Future:

+ Possibly integrate with [Cheet.js][1]

#### How it was Created:

+ CSS
+ [zurb / foundation][2] - The Most Advanced Responsive Front-End Framework In The World.


#### Documentation:
The main class to call is '.sneakery'. This sets up the container. You can make the container and size or shape you need. I have it defaulted to a 10 x 10 pixel square. Obviously the smaller you make the container the smaller the click target will be so keep that in mind.
You may want to make the 'background-color' or 'border' color something visible to ensure you have placed the container exactly as desired.

I have also supplied a 'hover' class so you can back the container a bit more obvious when you've found it. Again you may want the container to always be the color of the page background to keep it hidden.

I have also supplied 4 classes for different layout configurations. You can use one or many on the same page. I've tried to name the classes as intuitively as possible, 'topright', 'topleft', 'bottomright' and 'bottomleft'.

For **Foundation** Questions please see the documentation provided by Zurb on their respective repos and websites.

#### Feedback:
If you have feedback or issues with what I have specifically put together, please bring it up on this repo.
